#About AVL Tree	

<p>AVL Tree is a self-balancing Binary Search Tree. In this tree, Lookup, insertion, and deletion all take O(log n) time in both the average and worst cases, where n is the number of nodes in the tree prior to the operation. Insertiosn and deletions may require the tree to be rebalanaced by one or more tree rotations. </p>
