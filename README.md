Data-Strucutres
===============

#Objective

To learn all major Data structures and code them using C. Also observe benchmarks for various kinds of inputs. The final aim is to make plugins in PHP to connect all these data structures with the web so that custom queries can be run from web browser and results displayed on the browser itself (Something like MySQL but far far from it :D) Just to get an idea about how databases work and make something relevant in the end if possible
